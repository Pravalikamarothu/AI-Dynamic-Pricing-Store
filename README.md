## üîß API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- `GET /` - API status and information
- `POST /predict` - Get price prediction for a product
- `GET /metrics` - Retrieve model performance metrics
- `GET /products` - Get all products from dataset
- `POST /train` - Retrain the model
- `POST /upload-data` - Upload new training data

### Example API Usage

```python
# Predict price for a product
import requests

product_data = {
    "product_name": "Premium Cotton T-Shirt",
    "category": "T-Shirts",
    "base_price": 29.99,
    "inventory_level": 150,
    "competitor_avg_price": 28.50,
    "sales_last_30_days": 145,
    "rating": 4.2,
    "review_count": 128,
    "season": "Summer",
    "brand_tier": "Premium",
    "material_cost": 8.50
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/predict", json=product_data)
prediction = response.json()
print(f"Predicted price: ${prediction['predicted_price']}")
```

## üìà Model Performance

The system tracks comprehensive performance metrics:

- **R¬≤ Score**: Measures how well the model explains price variations
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error - average prediction error in dollars
- **MSE**: Mean Square Error - squared average of prediction errors
- **Feature Importance**: Shows which factors most influence pricing decisions
